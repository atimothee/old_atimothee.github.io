A few weeks back, Kwik Study was 1st runner-up at the Orange Community Innovation Awards held at the Kampala Serena Hotel.

This was the best possible reward after a gruelling 3 days of non-stop coding.

Kwik Study utilizes a proven method of revision. It uses flash cards to simplify nursery and primary students learning. It also provides a way for parents and teachers to monitor students academic progress.

I must confess I didn't see this coming.
