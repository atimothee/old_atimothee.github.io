<img id="portrait" src="/images/timothy_asiimwe.jpg" alt="prof_pic" />Hello, I'm Timothy Asiimwe. I'm a developer, student & community organizer. I love creating software for personal and open source projects.

I’ll be posting and sharing thoughts, ideas, experiences, and other things of interest. You're welcome to follow along. My open source work is available on [GitHub]('http://github.com/atimothee'), while my work history is on [LinkedIn]('http://ug.linkedin.com/in/timothyasiimwe'). And if you’d like to say hello, you’re more than welcome to do so at <mailto:atimothee@gmail.com>!
