Every once in a while I like to reflect on life. And there’s no better time than now. I literally have nothing to chase, no deadline to beat, no books, no exams. So I’ve been thinking, alot about the unobvious benefits of being a software developer.

Programming involves a lot of thinking and overtime, it changes the way you think about life and stuff in general. So here are five unintentional benefits to the programmer. I’ve gained from my experience writing code fo rthe most part of my waking hours

**1. It’s okay to fail:**

The error log is the developer’s friend. Having errors, exceptions and bugs are not something to be dreaded, instead to guide to make your program or code run better. This is a very helpful trait in life.

**2. Faith:**

A lot of software developers are willing to take on work they have no idea how to do. I think it’s partly because of the excitement that comes with it, but also because we do it over and over again. Somehow, I’ve learned to have the confidence that things will pan out okay, no matter how humongous the task at hand is.

**3. It’s never that serious:**


**4. Great software evolves: Embrace Change**

>“To change often is to be perfect”-Winston Churchill

There will come a time when you’ll trash what at one point you thought was great and such is life, as we grow, our priorities tend to shift. Therefore, embrace change.

If you own a smart device, then I’m sure you receive notifications of apps that want to update almost every week or even every day. I’ve learned to embrace change even radical change.
Nothing cements this more than the news this week that Apple released a new programming language. Although Objctive-C hasn’t been trashed per se. iOS devt will shift to Swift as the primary language. You have to be willing to try out new stuff. Theres a quote that goes “When you become a software engineer, you have to be willing t sign a life pact to keep learning”

**5. Let go:**
In line with point 4, sometimes you have to let go of that piece of code that you spend hours or days writing, either because its just ugly or its been rendered useless.

**6. Give back to the community Freely you have recieved, freely you should give**

We’re here today because of what others did long ago. Big companies have open sourced a lot of software projects. Open-source had driven the softwsare industry, so we’re indebited to give back to the software community and society at large. We are thriving on the shoulders of giants.

**The downside:**
You cant roll back life:
If you’re familiar with version control, then you know that you can roll back to a previous commit, in case you encounter serious problems with your code base and it will be like it never happened. Unfortunately in the real world, when you eff up, as much as you can move on, the scars remain.
